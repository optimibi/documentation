# Calculated Columns

A calculated column is a new data field created in the analytical model using SQL formulas.

## When to Use Calculated Columns

You should use calculated columns in the following scenarios:

- When row-by-row calculations are required.
- When you need to create a new data field based on existing columns.
- When you want to enhance the data model with additional information.

## How to Create a Calculated Column

1. **Enter Modeling View**

   Click the menu button at the top right corner of the data table, and select "Calculated Column" from the pop-up menu.

2. **Enter Column Name, Type, and SQL Expression**
