# Share link

By generating a "share link", the analysis report can be shared with others. The shared person can view the data or modify the report if they have a DATAFOR account or do not have a DATAFOR account. The data permissions viewed through the sharing link are the same as those of the sharer.

DATAFOR provides two sharing links:

- read only

   Anyone can access this link to view this report without a DATAFOR account. The data permissions are consistent with those of the sharer.

- edit

   Anyone can access this link to edit and view this report without a DATAFOR account. The data permissions are consistent with those of the sharer.

***Note: Users who do not have permission to edit files do not have permission to generate "edit" sharing links. **

## Pause sharing

In the share link list, turn off the "Turn on sharing" button. When the "Enable Sharing" switch is turned off, the sharing link becomes invalid.
