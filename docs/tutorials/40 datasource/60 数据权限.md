# Data security

Datafor supports setting data access permissions for different users, roles, and user types. The granularity of permission control is the row and column of the database table.
The data permission control is set on the "data source", and the analysis model can control whether to apply the permission settings on the data source.

The data permission setting entry is in the operation menu of "Data Connection":
