## Resizing Components

**Using Handles**:

- Select the component.
- Drag the resize handles at the corners or edges to adjust the component size.

**Entering Width and Height Values**:

- Enter the width and height values directly in the width and height input boxes on the toolbar. This method is particularly effective when resizing multiple components simultaneously.

## Switching Component Types

During the design process, you can switch component types while maintaining the original component's data model.

These features allow users to customize their Datafor dashboards and reports efficiently, ensuring that their data is presented clearly and effectively.
