# Chart Reference Lines

Chart reference lines refer to a set of marker lines added to a chart to assist users in analyzing and comparing data. Users can freely add, edit, and delete reference lines to meet their needs. Through reference lines, users can gain a clearer understanding of data trends and outliers.

## Types of Reference Lines

- **Constant Line:** Also known as a threshold line or target line, used to mark a fixed value or range. For example, if we want to set the sales target to 1 million, we can add a constant line in a bar chart or line chart to help us compare the actual sales with the target value.
- **Mean Line:** Also known as an average line or average reference line, used to mark the average value of data. The mean is the result of summing all the data and dividing by the number of data points, and it can help us understand the overall trend of the dataset. By adding a mean line, we can compare the differences between each data point and the overall trend.
- **Median Line:** Also known as a median reference line, used to mark the median value of data. The median is the value that is in the middle of the dataset when sorted in ascending or descending order. Compared to the mean, the median reflects the central location of the data distribution better, so the median line is also an important reference line when analyzing a dataset.
