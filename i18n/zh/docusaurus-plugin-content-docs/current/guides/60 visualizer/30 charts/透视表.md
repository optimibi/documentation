# Pivot table

A pivot table helps users quickly analyze large amounts of data by viewing data from different angles and dimensions and summarizing and calculating the data.

## Applicable scenario

- Summarizing data: Pivot tables can quickly summarize large amounts of data and are easy to use and understand.
- Grouping and aggregating data: Pivot tables can group and aggregate data in many ways, such as by department, salesperson, date, etc.
- Data analysis: Pivot tables can search for trends, patterns, and outliers in data and can dynamically change the grouping and aggregation methods to view different aspects of the data.

## Composition

1. Rows: Represents the categorical variable of each row in the pivot table, such as employee name, date, region, etc.

2. Columns: Represents the categorical variable of each column in the pivot table, such as department, product, etc.

3. Measures: Represents the data records in the pivot table, such as sales, inventory amount, etc.

4. Summary: Used to summarize the data, such as calculating the average, sum, maximum, minimum, etc.
