# Cross-Model and Cross-Data Source Analysis

Datafor's cross-model and cross-data source analysis feature enables users to integrate data from different sources into a single report, providing comprehensive data analysis and visualization. This functionality helps users associate and compare data across sources, offering deeper analytical insights.

## Features

- **Multi-Data Source Integration**: Users can set up different analysis models for different components within the same report, breaking down data silos and creating a global view.
- **Cross-Filtering**: Visual components from different analysis models support cross-filtering, enabling users to explore relationships between data from multiple dimensions.

## Use Case

Suppose a company wants to integrate financial and sales data to analyze market performance and track key financial metrics. Financial data is stored in an ERP system, while sales data resides in a CRM system. With Datafor's cross-model and cross-data source analysis, the company can visually present sales trends, cost analysis, profitability, and other key insights in a single report. Through cross-analysis, users can uncover potential connections between financial and sales data.

## Sample Data

## Creating Analysis Models

Next, we will create analysis models for two different data sources.

### Financial Analysis Model: finance_data

<div align="left"><img src="../../../../../static/img/en/datafor/analysis/1731233238801-1731234548377-7.png" /></div>

### Sales Analysis Model: sales_data

<div align="left"><img src="../../../../../static/img/en/datafor/analysis/1731233049272-1731234548377-8.png" /></div>

## Creating Analysis Reports

Use the `finance_data` model to create a line chart:

<div align="left"><img src="../../../../../static/img/en/datafor/analysis/1731233589755-1731234548377-9.png" /></div>

Use the `sales_data` model to create a bar chart:

<div align="left"><img src="../../../../../static/img/en/datafor/analysis/1731233692962-1731234548378-10.png" /></div>

## Cross-Analysis

In the data report, users can perform multi-dimensional analysis via cross-filtering:

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Can cross-analysis and filtering be performed when the field names in the two models are different?**

   **Answer**: Yes, as long as the field titles in the two models are consistent, cross-analysis can be performed.

2. **Can a filter component using fields from Model A subscribe to a chart component based on Model B?**

   **Answer**: Yes. If Model B has fields with the same titles as the filter component, it is possible to filter and perform cross-analysis.
