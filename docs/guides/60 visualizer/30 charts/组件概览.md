# Chart Components Overview

Datafor offers a rich set of visualization components to help users display and analyze data intuitively. Below is a brief introduction to the common visualization components in Datafor. Each component has its unique features and use cases, with detailed pages providing more specific information.

## 1. Pivot Table

The Pivot Table is used to display data in rows and columns. It allows for grouping, cross-referencing, and summarizing data, and enables user interactions such as sorting and filtering.

## 2. Table

The Table component displays data in a standard row and column format, suitable for presenting detailed information. Users can sort and filter the data within the table.

## 3. KPI Card

KPI Cards are used to show key performance indicators and compare them against target values. They provide a concise way to monitor critical business metrics.

## 4. Dimension Field Information

This component displays the dimension fields in a dataset and their related information.

## 5. Clustered Column 

The Clustered Column Chart presents data using adjacent vertical bars, ideal for comparing different categories.

## 6. Stacked Column 

The Stacked Column Chart shows the total value of data and its components through stacked bars, highlighting the contribution of each series.

## 7. 100% Stacked Column 

The 100% Stacked Column Chart displays the percentage of each data series relative to the total, rather than the absolute values, suitable for showing proportional relationships.

## 8. Clustered Bar 

The Clustered Bar Chart is similar to the Clustered Column Chart but uses horizontal bars. It's useful for comparing data when there are many categories.

## 9. Stacked Bar 

The Stacked Bar Chart displays the total value of data and its components through horizontally stacked bars, showing the contribution of each series.

## 10. 100% Stacked Bar 

The 100% Stacked Bar Chart shows the percentage of each data series relative to the total using horizontally stacked bars, ideal for illustrating proportions.

## 11. Line Chart

The Line Chart displays data trends and changes over time using a series of connected points and lines, suitable for time series data.

## 12. Column Line 

The Column Line Chart combines a column chart and a line chart, showing both total values and trends.

## 13. Pie Chart

The Pie Chart illustrates the composition and proportion of data through a circular division, highlighting the contribution of different categories.

## 14. Scatter Plot

The Scatter Plot shows the relationship between two numerical variables using dispersed points, indicating the distribution and trend of data.

## 15. Sunburst 

The Sunburst Chart represents data hierarchies through concentric rings, ideal for visualizing multi-level categorical data.

## 16. Gauge

The Gauge displays a single metric and its comparison against a target value, similar to the dials on a car dashboard.

## 17. Sankey

The Sankey Diagram shows data flow and distribution through the width and direction of flow lines, representing relationships between categories.

## 18. Parent-Child Tree Table

The Parent-Child Tree Table displays hierarchical relationships in data using a tree structure to show parent-child relationships.

## 19. Hierarchical Tree Table

The Hierarchical Tree Table represents data's hierarchical structure and classification through a tree structure, illustrating layers and relationships.
