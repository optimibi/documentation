# File and folder permissions

Files and folders in the "Private" folder cannot be set access permissions, only the logged-in user can see them.
Files and folders in the "Public" folder can be set through permission settings to control the user's access rights, including view, edit, delete, and full control.

Click the Actions menu for a file or folder and select the "Permissions" menu.

## Copy permissions to other files or folders

When the permissions of files and folders are consistent with those of files and folders that have been set before, you can use the "Copy Permissions to..." function to avoid setting permissions repeatedly.

Select "Copy Permissions to..." from the pop-up menu.
