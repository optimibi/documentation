# List Box

List box is used to provide a set of items (data items) from which the user can select one or more items using a mouse. However, the user cannot directly edit the data in the list box.

## Setting Data

A list box can display a field from a dimension or hierarchy.

<div align="left"><img src="../../../../../../static/img/en/datafor/visualizer/1681966583204.png"  width="70%" /></div>

**Associated Fact Table**: Associates the dimension table with the real-time table. When this switch is enabled, if there are no dimension-related records in the real-time table, the dimension data will not appear in the list box. In addition, the component filtering is also affected by the "Associated Real-time Table" switch. When this switch is turned on, any dimension in the model or field on the fact table can be used to filter the list box field.

**Multiple Selection**: Allows multiple selection of items in the list box.

**Default Value Type**: Fixed default value and relative default value. The fixed default value is to select one or more fixed items from the list as the default selection. Relative default value: first item, last item.

## Setting Behaviors

**Subscribers**: Establish a "filter" relationship between the list box component and other components on the page. The selected value in this list box will be the "filter" subscribed by the affected components.

**Parameters**: Assign the selected value in the list to the relevant parameter.

**Custom Process**: Embed JavaScript code to execute during different rendering stages of the component.

For example, when we need to adjust the rendering effects of a component, we can intervene in this custom process "before execution."

```js
function shouldExecute(require, options){
    options.value = options.value?.slice(0, 3) || [];
    return true;
}
```

This logic will cause the list component to always display only the first 3 items of the list data.
