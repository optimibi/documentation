# Quick Calculated Measures

## Overview

Datafor's Quick Calculated Measures feature allows users to quickly create various common measures through a simplified interface and predefined calculation logic. This is especially useful for users who are not familiar with MDX (Multidimensional Expressions) syntax. Quick Calculated Measures include sums, year-to-date totals, year-over-year comparisons, month-over-month comparisons, and other common business needs.

## Advantages of Quick Calculated Measures

- **Simplified Calculation Process**: No need to write complex MDX formulas; common measures can be quickly created through a graphical interface.
- **Increased Efficiency**: The Quick Calculated Measures feature speeds up the process of creating measures, especially for common business needs.
- **Easy to Understand**: Previewing and auto-generating formulas help users understand the calculation logic, enhancing data analysis skills.

## When to Create Quick Calculated Measures

1. **When Creating or Editing an Analysis Model**

   When creating or editing an analysis model, click the "New Measure" button and select "New quick measure."
