The Image component is used to display the Base64 encoding of the image or the hyperlink of the image.

## What is the Base64 encoding of pictures

The base64 encoding of a picture is to encode a piece of picture data into a string of strings, and use this string to replace the image address.

The following code is the base64 encoding of a picture:

```
<img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhHAAmAKIHAKqqqsvLy0hISObm5vf394uLiwAAAP///yH5Bâ€¦EoqQqJKAIBaQOVKHAXr3t7txgBjboSvB8EpLoFZywOAo3LFE5lYs/QW9LT1TRk1V7S2xYJADs=">
```

## What is a hyperlink to an image

A hyperlink image is a hyperlink pointing to an image.

For example: https://datafor.com.cn/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Datafor-logo-2.png
